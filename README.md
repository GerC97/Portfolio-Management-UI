# Portfolio-Manager
A Tkinter UI for pulling Historical Stock Data from Yahoo Finance


The Tkinter UI is split up into three main sections.

The first section 'Custom Portfolio Tools' allows users to create a custom portfolio by entering tickers manually into the UI or by uploading a .csv file.
Once a portfolio is created, users can acess a range of functions like 'Raw Data' (historical prices), 'Correlation Matrix' (a correlation matrix derived from the returns of securities over a specified period), 'Daily Returns' (Day to Day % change), 'Performance' (Performance over a specified period), 'Plot Returns' (% Returns vs Time), 'Scenarios'(A look at how the portfolio returned during some key historical events) and 'Statistics'(some basic statistics and ratios).

The second section consists of a brief summary of whats happening across global indices, currencies, crypto currencies and bond markets.

The third section consists of a Black-Scholes approximation for pricing Call/Put Options.
